# Ember2-todomvc

This is [todomvc](http://todomvc.com/) project for EmberJs v2. On [http://todomvc.com/](http://todomvc.com/)
we can see just application for very old version 1.10.0-beta.3. It does not work for EmberJs v2.
But application Ember2-todomvc supports last release of EmberJs framework.
Please, send any comments about my implementation.
